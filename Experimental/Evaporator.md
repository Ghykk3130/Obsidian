# Note:
- All you want is in the low voltage.
- Source A: Cr bar  Source B: W boat
- $400mg$ Au corresponds roughly to $120 nm$. Half inch$\sim$ $100mg$ Au. A typical recipe: $150 nm$ Au $10nm$ Cr
- The film on the thickness reader corresponds to the specific recipe of evaporation. Different films have different calibration. For Cr use recipe 1, for Au use recipe 2.
- When get to $3\times 10^{-6}\ Torr$, can start evaporation.
