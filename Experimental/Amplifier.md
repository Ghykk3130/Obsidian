Criterion: 
1. $GBW$ should be enough. ($GBW =$ bandwidth when gain $=1$) ($GBW = Gain \times Bandwidth$)
2. $SR$ should be enough. 
Problems:
3. OP 27G: suspect that SR is not enough. Distorted into triangular wave at above $40 K Hz$. Need the SR to be 15 times higher. SR of OP 27G is $2.8 V/\mu s$. Need $42 V/\mu s$ or higher.
