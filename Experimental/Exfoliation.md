## Step 1
- single-sided white tape to clean off the table
- double-sided white tapes are in the drawer
- cut wafer larger than the bulk
## Step 2
- put double-sided tapes on wafer. tapes should be flat. don't use tapes with bubbles
- put wafer on double-sided tapes. wafers should not be close to edges. 3 pieces each glass-slide.
- clean dusts off the wafer using air flow
## Step 3
- attach double-sided white tapes to table vertically. one blue table attached horizontally
- when exfoliating, use a single-sided white tape, fold the edges for easier manipulation. Cover the bulk with this tape, use cotton swab to quickly flatten the tape to ensure bulk is attached on both sides. Then peel off quickly.
- For hbn, repeat $5\sim 6$ times. For tmd, repeat $7\sim 8$ times, until it looks yellowish.
- probably also use blue tape, for finer control.
- keep track of inheritage.
## Step 4
- put the white tape peeled off over wafer. Use cotton swab to press gently to avoid fracture. For tmd, smear $150s$ in the transverse direction. 
## Step 5
- for tmd, bake the sample at $90 C^{\circ}$ for $60s$. for hbn, no need of baking.
- attach two pieces of glass slides to the platform with white tape. attach the corners and the middle part of the two glass slides. Then attach the white tape on wafer to the peeling machine.
