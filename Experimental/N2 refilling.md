## Step 1
- attach supply, and vent hose to the dewar. Use wrench to tighten. don't open the vent and liquid valves on the dewar.
- zero the scale
- unlock password: $38-20-2$. ccw to $38$, the cw with 2 turns to $20$, then ccw to $2$
## Step 2
- switch the vent handle first on tube, then supply handle. after $15\sim 20s$, the sound would go down, then switch off the vent handle on tube, open the vent valve, and then the liquid valve on dewar. 
- fully open the valves on the dewar because of the wanky valves on dewar. 
- stay away from the pressure gauge. could be outgassing.
## Step 3
- wait until the weight is $190 lbs$. (full weight should be $500lbs$.)
- switch off the supply handle on tube, then close the liquid valve, then vent valve on dewar.
- don't overtighten the valves on dewar, since after warming up, would expand.
