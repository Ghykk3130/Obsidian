- Change angles if attaching wires is hard.
- If contact resistance too large, try reattaching the wire to the puck several times.
- If zero field, room temperature, order of magnitude in multimeters not the same, means anomaly. Noise should be of the same order of magnitude.
- Check sample contact one day before loading.
