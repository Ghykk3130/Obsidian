The larger the load resistance is, the larger the effective resistance in the primary circuit would be. Then the current would decrease, and the error would decrease. 

When capacitance increases, the impedance would be lower. Recall $Z_C = \frac{1}{i\omega C}$ . So the current would increase, inducing more error. 

## Comment 2

The phase shift is the phase shift of the ideal voltage source due to internal impedance. If the resistance of the load is large, then the phase shift should be small. If the capacitance of the load is large, then 

## Comment 3

There would be inductive coupling or capacitive coupling inside a circuit due to the configuration. Adding an extra transformer may reduce direct connection through wires, thus preventing these effects.

## Comment 4

This is the error cause by the loading effect of the voltmeter.

## Comment 5

The uncalibrated voltage divider is adjusted such that the voltage across $V_2$ is matches with the voltage across the load directly. 

## Question 1

How to analyze this circuit? More specifically, if I ground pin 5 of the secondary, is the primary also grounded? 

## Comment 6

In this configuration, the decade transformer acts like a precision voltage divider, meaning that it magnifies and divides the voltage.

## Comment 7

There's nothing squared because $Z_X,Z_S$ are connected in series. The ratio of their voltages represent the ratio of their impedance. There's no square in the ratio of voltages.
