# Transfer function

Recall the Laplace transform: $F(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-st}dt$
>[! Definition 1]
>Let $y(t),u(t)$ be the output and input. Then is transfer function is
>$D(s)= \frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}$, where $Y(s),U(s)$ are the Laplace transforms of $y(t),u(t)$.

## Ex
Consider a driven oscillation $m\ddot{x}+b\dot{x}+kx=f(t)$
Take $x(t),f(t)$ as the output and input. Then
