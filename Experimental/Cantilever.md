Setup:
![[29924ad54f9584d657331f4d93c095f2.jpg|500]]
- Lower plate to 6, upper plate to 1. Metalized face up. 
- 25 turns $\approx$ $90^{\circ}$
- Viewing from the top, ccw corresponds to increasing $\theta$.
- Get stuck at $\theta \approx 80^{\circ}$
- Bad pillars: everything to the right of F, G, H. Coax all good 
- Cantilever thickness: $1mil=0.001^{''}$
- Cantilever arm width: $\sim1.5mm$
- Cantilever pad dimension: $\sim 4\times 2mm$
- Real measurement: scan to $41T$, with $3T/ min$.

Measure the resistance. Connect the current to coax 1, 6, the 4-wire connections to F, G.

Pump down the probe and rotate.  Record the capacitance value of the cantilever. 
- $0^{\circ}$, $0.536$
- $90^{\circ}$ , $0.528$
- Go back to $0^{\circ}$, $0.528$
- Go to $90^{\circ}$ again, $0.526$
- Go back to $0^{\circ}$, $0.527$
- Go back to $0^{\circ}$, $0.527$

When rotate, observe relaxation $\sim 0.001 pF$. Suspect that the cantilever is bending back against gravity. Should take data after the cantilever settles down.
