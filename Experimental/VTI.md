Probe vacuum pumping:
- 3-terminal gas valve: right$\rightarrow$pump, left$\rightarrow$vent, down$\rightarrow$seal
- When $p<1 \text{ torr}$, switch to turbo pump.
- $p>10^{-5}$ indicates a leakage.

VTI cool down:
- He pump should be open when open the needle valve connecting the He bath and the sample tube. Avoid He accumulation.
- Monitor the temperature of the He bath to ensure:
	- $T$ is not too high of course
	- $T$ is not too low such that the atmospheric pressure outweighs the pressure inside the He bath too much. Then air would sneak in.
Valves: ccw for open, cw for close

The only connection between the sample tube and the helium bath is the outside pumping line. The pump is taking He out from the sample tube and back into the helium bath + reliquifier. Due to the positive pressure from the helium bath, the He gas won't go back into the He bath.
