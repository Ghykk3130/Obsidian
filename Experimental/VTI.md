Probe vacuum pumping:
- 3-terminal gas valve: right$\rightarrow$pump, left$\rightarrow$vent, down$\rightarrow$seal
- When $p<1 \text{ torr}$, switch to turbo pump.
- $p>10^{-5}$ indicates a leakage.

VTI cool down:
- He pump should be open when open the needle valve connecting the He bath and the sample tube. Avoid He accumulation.
- Monitor the temperature of the He bath to ensure:
	- $T$ is not too high of course
	- $T$ is not too low such that the atmospheric pressure outweighs the pressure inside the He bath too much. Then air would sneak in.
