Chinese ceramics circulated widely in the Middle East during the ninth and tenth centuries. Key evidence comes from port sites like Siraf in the Gulf and inland cities such as Samarra, where Chinese ceramics were found in elite contexts, indicating their high value. A major source of evidence is the Belitung shipwreck, an Arab dhow dating to the early ninth century. Its cargo consisted predominantly of Chinese ceramics, especially Changsha wares with polychrome designs, including pseudo-Arabic inscriptions, made specifically for Middle Eastern markets. This reveals direct maritime trade and rapid artistic exchange, with Middle Eastern motifs being copied in China and then re-exported. Later tenth-century wrecks, like Intan and Cirebon, show a shift in supply. Southern Chinese celadons, particularly Yue ware, replaced Changsha ware as the dominant export, and Southeast Asian ships and entrep√¥ts became crucial intermediaries in this trade, assembling mixed cargoes for regional markets.
