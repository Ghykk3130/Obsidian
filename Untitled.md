The Wu Liang Ci is a family shrine of the Wu family in the Eastern Han dynasty. The site ware recorded by Ouyang Xiu and Zhao Mingcheng in the Song dynasty based on rubbings. Modern discovery began in 1786 by the Qing scholar Huang Yi. There are four shinres: the Wu Liang Ci, the Front Chamber, the Rear Chamber, and the Left Chamber. The discovery of the fourth chamber was proposed because of the mismatch of the roof slabs and unassigned stones. There are personalized motifs and inscriptions possibly indicating the owners of the shrines, but this remains unproven. The shrines indicates a shift from the individual memorials for burial practices to the ritual centers for extended families.
