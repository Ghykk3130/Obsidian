**4-gram short text with prompt 1:**
- the building , at his countenance , i thought , wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity . he accosted me with trepidation and passed on . the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master . much that i encountered on the way contributed , i know not how , to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building in front , made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction , to the words of one of these rhapsodies i

**4-gram short text with prompt 3:**
- it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the man being before me with the companion of my early boyhood . yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable . a cadaverousness of complexion . an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison . lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a surpassingly beautiful curve . a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations . a finely-moulded chin , speaking , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated

- the building , and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears . the disease of the lady madeline of usher . there was blood upon her white robes , and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame . for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold , --then , with a low moaning cry , fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother , and in her violent and now final death-agonies , bore

**5-gram short text with prompt 2:**
- during the last few minutes , taken place in his demeanour . from a position fronting my own , he had gradually brought round his chair , so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber . and thus i could but partially perceive his features , although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly . his head had dropped upon his breast--yet i knew that he was not asleep , from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile . the motion

# 1. Question 1

Increasing the size of $N$ seems to improve the performance of the model. It seems that the logical coherence of models with larger $N$ is better. For example, for 5-gram short text with prompt 1, the phrases "emaciated fingers," "passionate tears," and "blood upon her white robes" all logically connect to the central theme of decay and illness established by "the disease of the Lady Madeline." This is because the 5-gram model has a larger context window.

Increasing the training text size also seems to improve the quality of the story that I generated. For example, in the 5-gram long text with prompt 1, the  model does not repeat a single large passage but rather combines smaller, coherent phrases like "helped him off with his overcoat," "the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again" into a new sequence. It implies that the larger training text provides a much richer library of word patterns. In comparison, in the 5-gram short text with prompt 1, the model included a lot of verbatim quote from the original story. "A far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears. The disease of the Lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white robes" is a verbatim quote from the original text. 

I observe that if we fix the training text size, the larger $N$ is, the less creative the model would be. This makes sense because if we restrict $N$, the model is forced to make up sentences based on smaller fragments.  

I also observe that the larger the $N$ is, the more coherent and grammatically correct the generated text would be. For example, in the 3-gram short text with prompt 1, the model wrote: "the building in my mind a strange alteration". This is ungrammatical. This also makes sense because to make grammar correct, the model has to take into account of the context, which requires a larger $N$.

# 2. Question 2

I think the 4-gram long text model is the best performer because it achieves the balance between creativity and coherence.

As I argued above, the relatively small N-gram size allows for more flexibility, generating novel and unique passages that rearrange phrases in new ways. This model combines ideas to produce fresh combinations.

Also, the large training text size from _Dubliners_ provides a vast library of word patterns, which compensate for the disadvantage of its relatively small N-gram size. This means that if the training text is long enough, even with a relatively small N-gram size, the model can select grammatically sound word sequences. 
# 3. Question 3

The biggest limitation is that SnapGPT cannot take into account of the full context. It can only use a fixed number of words determined by the N-gram size to generate what is coming next, and therefore connect an idea from the beginning of a paragraph. The "memory" of the model is fundamentally limited by the way it is constructed.

Another limitation is that the model can only generate texts based on the given training text. If your prompt consists entirely of words that are not in the training text, the model won't know what to generate, because it cannot assign probability to it.
