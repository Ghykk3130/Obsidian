Yungang Grottoes is a Buddhist site built in the Northern Wei dynasty around 460 AD. The caves suggests the investment of the Northern Wei imperial group into religion, which might contribute to the Northern Wei's collapse. 

There were two construction phases of the Yungang Grottoes. The first phase (c. 460-467) was related to imperial authority. Five caves were constructed and Buddhas representing the first five Northern Wei emperors were erected. This might be considered as a atonement of the imperial group for the persecution of Buddhism. The second phase (c. 483-494) emerged later, with more concentration on commoners' work. Carvings in this period featured more narrative complex themes in Buddhism. 

There were threats to the preservation of the caves due to natural erosion, industrial pollution from a nearby city, and the water seepage from a Ming fortress above the caves.
