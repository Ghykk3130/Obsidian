Taoist art is based on its subject matter and ritual function instead of the artist's personal beliefs. 

There are three types of subjects: deified Laozi, the highest gods, and functional deities. The highest gods include the Sanqing, such as Yuanshi Tianzun. The functional deities include Sanguan, who judge human fate, and Zhenwu, whose importance suppressed Laozi's in the Ming dynasty. 

Taoist art serves ritual function. Fu is a calligraphic seal to embody primordial energy for protection. Swords are used for exorcism. Daopao is also a ritual object with cosmic symbols. 

There are misconceptions about Taoism. Taoism has deep roots in imperial court. For example, Empress Zhang's 27-meter-long ordination certificate illustrates the importance of Taoism. Literati engagement is also not negligible in Taoism. For example, the famous painter Ni Zan paintings with Taoist themes.
