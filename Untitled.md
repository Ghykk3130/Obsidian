The visuality of women in early Chinese history has been through a series of transitions, which implies the social roles and cultural ideals of women in particular historical periods. 

Noble women in the Shang dynasty was always related to the management of important courses of the tribe, opposed to people's common sense. For example, in the tomb of Lady Hao, bronze ritual objects, jade objects, along with a large number of weapons were excavated, from which scholars suspect that Lady Hao was highly trusted by the king of the Shang dynasty, and thus was given the job of military management and ritual performances. It is believed that these courses were exclusively significant for the tribe in the Shang dynasty, which featuring outward military expansion and divinations. Therefore, the roles of noble women was not limited to familial issues, but were strongly related to power, different from later periods in Chinese history.

Later in the Jin dynasty, women's jobs were more more concentrated on helping the male power, instead of being in the dominating position as in the Shang dynasty. In the famous painting Nushi Zhen Tu, a series of scenes describing the Confucian ideals of women were depicted. The virtue of women were emphasized. They were asked to be advisors for their husbands, to guide them aways from negative temptations. This can be seen as an influence of Confucianism, which was develped in the Zhou dynasty, previous to the Jin dynasty. In Confucianism, everyone in the society should stick to their social roles and keep personal morality, consistent with the theme in Nushi Zhen Tu. 

In Tang dynasty, with a more open cultural atmosphere, women were encouraged to focus more on their personal lives, relatively free of the regulations and ideals set in the previous dynasties. It can be observed from famous paintings in the Tang dynasty, for example, the Daolian Tu, that women's clothes featured silk, flowers, and other types of decoration materials, emphasizing female bodily beauty. Women were allowed to enjoy their personal lives by entertainment in the gardens. Moreover, in other artifacts from the Tang dynasty, sculptures of women wearing men's clothes were found, indicating a transition of gender roles. This might be due to the prosperity of economies in the Tang dynasty, as the country's cultural atmosphere became more open. 

Above all, we observed a transition of women's duties and ideals throughout the early dynasties in China by analyzing ancient artifacts. We saw that in Shang's dynasty, women was highly bounded with power and ruling. Then later, with the rise of Confucianism,  they lost their dominating positions and had to stick to women rituals required by Confucianism to help their husbands. Then with the rise of economies, women's gender roles were relaxed and women were allowed to concentrated more on personal life and self-entertainment. These transitions in not only show us a continuous changing pictures of women visuality, but also demonstrate how the society might influence these pictures in Chinese history.  

Revised: 

The representation of women in early Chinese art underwent significant transitions, reflecting shifting social roles and cultural ideals across different dynasties.

In the Shang dynasty, elite women could hold substantial secular and ritual power, as evidenced by the tomb of **Lady Hao (Fu Hao)**. The excavation of bronze ritual vessels, jade objects, and a vast arsenal of weapons suggests she was not only a priestess but also a military leader. This indicates that in the early Shang state, gender roles may have been more fluid, allowing royal women to wield authority in the critical spheres of warfare and divination, a stark contrast to later periods.

By the Six Dynasties period, the visual ideal for women had shifted to emphasize their role as moral auxiliaries to male power. The Eastern Jin painting _**Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies**_ (_Nushi Zhen Tu_) is a visual treatise on Confucian feminine virtues. Scenes like Lady Ban refusing to ride with the emperor teach that a woman's duty is to correct a man's minor errors and safeguard his moral character. Here, women's visuality is framed by didacticism and warning, portraying their primary value as upholding a rigid social hierarchy through personal integrity and deference.

The Tang dynasty witnessed another shift, celebrating a more open and aestheticized vision of female life. In paintings like **_Court Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk_ (_Daolian Tu_)**, women are depicted in luxurious silks, engaged in graceful, leisurely labor within ornate gardens. This focus on bodily beauty, fashion, and personal enjoyment reflects the Tang's prosperous and cosmopolitan culture. Furthermore, the existence of tomb figurines depicting women in men's clothing hints at a temporary relaxation of strict gender boundaries, suggesting that elite women could enjoy a degree of social freedom and self-expression not seen in the preceding centuries.

In summary, the visual record charts a clear evolution: from the direct power of Lady Hao, to the constrained morality of the _Admonitions_ scroll, and finally to the cultivated elegance and relative freedom of Tang women. These transitions demonstrate that the "visuality" of women was a powerful barometer of the broader philosophical, political, and economic currents in Chinese history.



Angles for object analysis:
- The most general: first describe what is it? What's its functions (if any)? Then for traits: 
- From big to small
- From concrete to abstract
- Material and color should be mentioned later. More concrete visual elements should be mentioned first
- Possibly mention casting technique
- For jade, comment on the precision cutting, since jade is hard to carve.
