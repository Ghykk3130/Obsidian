In Neolithic China, bronze objects held a very important role in both ritual and cultural contexts.

Bronzes of the Shang dynasty were closely related to the beliefs of Shang culture. The taotie totem often appeared on Shang bronzes. The taotie was believed to be connected with the ancestors of the Shang and their ritual culture. From the bronzes, we can see that Shang culture inherited elements from earlier Neolithic cultures and was influenced by contemporary neighboring cultures, yet it also developed its own distinctive characteristics. For example, the taotie motif had prototypes in the Liangzhu culture, but the Shang version exhibited many features unique to Shang culture and absent in Liangzhu. A large number of bronzes unearthed from the tomb of Fu Hao show similarities between Shang totems and those on bronzes from southern and eastern regions, indicating that Shang culture was not isolated.

In the Western Zhou period, the proportion of food vessels among bronzes increased, and the craftsmanship of bronze-making also improved. It is believed that the Western Zhou inherited the Shang bronze-making techniques, and bronzes continued to serve ritual functions, maintaining aspects of Shang culture. Western Zhou bronzes became more standardized, with reduced decorative features and an increased presence of inscriptions.

During the Eastern Zhou period, bronze-making techniques were further advanced under the influence of goldwork technologies. At the same time, new motifs that had spread from Central Asia appeared in motif.

By the Han dynasty, bronze artifacts had largely disappeared and were replaced by ceramics. This indicates that Han society and culture differed from those of the Shang and Zhou periods.
