The tomb of Qinshihuang consists of a central area and surrounding zones. The central area has not yet been excavated. According to Sima Qian, it contained rivers of mercury, a celestial ceiling, and the buried body of the emperor. The surrounding area is most notable for the presence of the terra-cotta warriors.

The terra-cotta army is distributed across four pits and is composed of terra-cotta figures. It could be understood as representing the imperial army and symbolically scenes of military life. Their production was highly standardized: over five hundred figures bear numbering marks, and about eighty-five bear the signatures of craftsmen. Details on the figures reflect military rank and role, allowing us to distinguish high-ranking officers, middle-ranking officers, kneeling archers, charioteers, and other types of soldiers. Each figure shows individualized facial expressions and bodily postures, which are thought to have been deliberate variations introduced by artisans following a standardized model, rather than portraits of real individuals.

The terra-cotta warriors mark a shift in Chinese art from abstract subjects to realistic forms, reflecting the personal will of Qinshihuang. Such funerary figures continued to be found in later Han and Tang dynasty tombs.
