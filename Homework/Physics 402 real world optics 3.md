The Thorlab N-BK7 Plano-Convex lens with $f=99.7mm$ has a radius of curvature of $51.5 mm$. The radius of curvature that I found last time is $9.72cm$, which differs greatly from the Thorlab lens. 

They differ because the wavelengths of the light are different. For the Thorlab lens, the wavelength they used for testing is $587.6nm$. But my calculation was based on $2.5 \mu m$. The refractive index is different for different light.

They differ also because in my calculation, I used the thin lens approximation. While in real life, thin lens doesn't exist. The Thorlab lens has a center thickness of $2.2mm$, and an edge thickness of $1.8mm$.
