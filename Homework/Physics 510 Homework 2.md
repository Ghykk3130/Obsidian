Consider the sphere in the problem placed far from any matter. The sphere is only allowed to exchange energy with the surroundings through heat. Consider changing the state of the sphere by putting in a small amount of heat $\rlap{d}\bar{\phantom{w}}Q$ reversibly. Then we have:
$$C= \frac{\rlap{d}\bar{\phantom{w}}Q}{dT}= \frac{dU}{dT}$$
now put the sphere on a horizontal surface in gravitational field. Change the state of the sphere such that the initial and final states are the same as the previous case. Then we have:
$$C^{'}= \frac{\rlap{d}\bar{\phantom{w}}Q^{'}}{dT}= \frac{dU^{'}- \rlap{d}\bar{\phantom{w}}W}{dT}$$
Since $U$ is a state function, I have: 
$$dU=dU^{'}$$
Also, 
$$\begin{align}
\rlap{d}\bar{\phantom{w}}W & =\int_{sphere} d^{3}r\rho gdy \\
 & = \int_{sphere}d^{3}r\rho g(-\alpha ydT) \\
 & =-\alpha dTg\int_{sphere}d^{3}r\rho y \\
 & =-\alpha dTgmR
\end{align}$$
Then I have:
$$C^{'}=C+\alpha mgR$$
Similarly, for the sphere hanging from the ceiling, I have:
$$\begin{align}
 & C^{''}= \frac{dU^{''}- \rlap{d}\bar{\phantom{w}}W^{'}}{dT} \\
 & dU^{''}=dU \\
 & \rlap{d}\bar{\phantom{w}}W^{'}=\alpha dTg\int_{sphere}d^{3}r\rho y=\alpha dTgmR \\
\implies & C^{''}=C-\alpha mgR
\end{align}$$
Then their heat capacity difference is:
$$C+\alpha mgR-(C-\alpha mgR)=2\alpha mgR$$

- a). is not consistent with thermodynamic laws. It violates the first law. 
- b). is consistent with thermodynamic laws. The first law is obviously satisfied. Now take the two heat reservoirs, the engine, and the work reservoir as an isolated system. The total change of entropy in one cycle is $\frac{50}{800}- \frac{10}{400}= \frac{3}{80} >0$. So it does not violate the second law.
- c). is not consistent with thermodynamic laws. It violates the second law because all heat are (solely) turned into work.
- d). is not consistent with thermodynamic laws. The efficiency should be bounded above by $1- \frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}=  0.5$, but the actual efficiency is $0.8$.
