Here we adopt the paraxial approximation such that the image of spherical lenses could be easily calculated. For the first surface, we have:
$$\frac{n_{1}}{s_{1}}+ \frac{n_{2}}{s_{1}^{'}}= \frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{R_{1}}$$
Substitute in $n_{1}=1, n_{2}=1.5, s_{1}=8 cm, R_{1}=-20cm$, we have: $s_{1}^{'}=-10cm$

The magnification is $m_{1}=\frac{n_{2}s_{1}^{'}}{n_{1}s_{1}}=-\frac{15}{8}$

The image of the first surface is to the left of the vertex of the first surface. Since the central thickness of the lens is $5cm$, for the second surface, we have:
$$\frac{n_{2}}{-s_{1}^{'}+5}+ \frac{n_{1}}{s_{1}^{''}}= \frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{R_{2}}$$
Substitute in $R_{2}=10cm$, we obtain:
$$s_{1}^{''}=- \frac{20}{3}cm$$
The magnification is $m_{2}= \frac{n_{1}s_{1}^{''}}{n_{2}(-s_{1}^{'}-5)}= -\frac{8}{27}$

Then the image is to the left of the second surface. Therefore the distance of the final image to the vertex of the first surface is $-\frac{20}{3}+5= -\frac{5}{3}cm$. This image is to the left of the vertex of the first lens, with an absolute distance of $\frac{5}{3}cm$.

The overall magnification is $m=m_{1}\cdot m_{2}=\frac{5}{9}$. So the height of the image is $2.5 \times \frac{5}{9} \approx 1.389 cm$. The image is not inverted.
