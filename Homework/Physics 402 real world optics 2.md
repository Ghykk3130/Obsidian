I know that I can treat the lens as two surfaces located at the origin. The for the image formed by the first surface, I have:
$$\frac{n_{1}}{s}+ \frac{n_{2}}{s^{'}}= \frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{R}$$
Assume that the two surfaces have the same curvature. Then for the second surface, I have:
$$- \frac{n_{2}}{s^{'}}+ \frac{n_{1}}{s^{''}}= \frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{-R}$$
The minus sign in front of $\frac{n_{2}}{s^{'}}$ is because for the image of the first surface is taken as the object of the second surface. According to the sign convention, there should be a minus sign in the front. Adding these two equations to get:
$$\frac{n_{1}}{s}+ \frac{n_{2}}{s^{''}}= \frac{2n_{2}-2n_{1}}{R}$$
I know that parallel light would be concentrated at $s^{''}=f$. Then take $s\rightarrow \infty$ I get:
$$\frac{n_{2}}{f}= \frac{2n_{2}-2n_{1}}{R}$$
$$\implies R=2(n-1)f$$
Choose BK7 glass, with $n=1.486$ for light with wavelength of $2.5\mu m$, I have:
$$R\approx{9}.72cm$$
