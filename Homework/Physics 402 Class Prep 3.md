Clearly, given a point on the object, there exist some rays from this point reaching the lens. Even for the extreme case, where a ray from the top of the object touches the top of the aperture, we can still see that this ray is able to reach the lens. The landing position of this ray on the lens would be $\frac{5}{3}cm$ above the optical axis by simple geometry.

So the magnification and the image distance can be calculated as if there is no aperture. We have:
$$\frac{1}{s}+ \frac{1}{s^{'}}=\frac{1}{f}\implies s^{'}=8 cm$$
$$m= - \frac{s^{'}}{s}=-1$$
The entrance pupil is simply the aperture itself, since there are no optics between the object and the aperture. We find the location of the exit pupil:
$$\frac{1}{r}+ \frac{1}{r^{'}}= \frac{1}{f}\implies r^{'}=-4cm$$
This means the exit pupil is a virtual image located at $4cm$ to the left of the vertex of the lens. The image is inverted.
