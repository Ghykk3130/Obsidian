Ray tracing software include Zemax OpticStudio, CODE V, OSLO, FTED,... The most popular ones are probably Popular  Zemax OpticStudio and CODE V. Zemax OpticStudio costs about 5,000 dollars per year on average. CODE V costs about 10,000 dollars per year on average. I think it is very hard to write a realistic ray tracing program. This is because we have to take into account nonideal effects like aberrations, stray light, diffractions, ... But writing a simple ray tracing program would be doable because we  can use approximations to simplify the calculations. The reason why designing optical systems is underlines is because we need to calculate for a realistic system, with multiple optics inside.
