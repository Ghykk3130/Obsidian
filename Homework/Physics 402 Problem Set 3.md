The image of the object is given by:
$$\begin{align}
 & \frac{1}{s_{o}}+ \frac{1}{s_{o}^{'}}= \frac{1}{f} \\
 & s_{o}= 12cm, f=5cm \\
\implies & s_{o}^{'}= \frac{60}{7}cm \\
\implies & m=- \frac{s_{o}^{'}}{s_{o}}= - \frac{5}{7} \\
\implies & h_{o}^{'}= mh_{o}= - \frac{10}{7}cm
\end{align}$$
So the image of the object is a real image located at $\frac{60}{7}cm$ to the right of the lens. The image is inverted with a height of $- \frac{10}{7}cm$.

Since the images of the diaphragm and the lens in the object space are all real, and the diaphragm subtends the smallest angle, we know that the diaphragm is the aperture stop. 

Then the entrance pupil is obviously the diaphragm itself, because there's no optics between the object and the diaphragm. 

The exit pupil is given by:
$$\begin{align}
 & \frac{1}{s_{p}}+ \frac{1}{s_{p}^{'}}= \frac{1}{f} \\
 & s_{p}=3cm,f=5cm \\
\implies & s_{p}^{'}=- \frac{15}{2}cm \\
\implies & m=- \frac{s_{p}^{'}}{s_{p}}=\frac{5}{2} \\
\implies & h_{p}^{'}=mh_{p}=5 cm
\end{align}$$
where $h_{p}$ is the diameter of the diaphragm. So the exit pupil is located at $-\frac{15}{2}cm$ to the left of the lens, with a diameter of $5cm$. It is not inverted.

If we view the optical system from the center of the entrance pupil, the lens would subtends the smallest angle. Then the lens is the field stop. 

The entrance window is obviously the lens itself, since there's no optics between the lens and the input plane. The exit window is also the lens itself, since there's no optics between the lens and the output plane.
