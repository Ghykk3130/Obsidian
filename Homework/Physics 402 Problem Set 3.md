## a).
The image of the object is given by:
$$\begin{align}
 & \frac{1}{s_{o}}+ \frac{1}{s_{o}^{'}}= \frac{1}{f} \\
 & s_{o}= 12cm, f=5cm \\
\implies & s_{o}^{'}= \frac{60}{7}cm \\
\implies & m=- \frac{s_{o}^{'}}{s_{o}}= - \frac{5}{7} \\
\implies & h_{o}^{'}= mh_{o}= - \frac{10}{7}cm
\end{align}$$
So the image of the object is a real image located at $\frac{60}{7}cm$ to the right of the lens. The image is inverted with a height of $- \frac{10}{7}cm$.

Since the images of the diaphragm and the lens in the object space are all real, and the diaphragm subtends the smallest angle, we know that the diaphragm is the aperture stop. 

Then the entrance pupil is obviously the diaphragm itself, because there's no optics between the object and the diaphragm. 

The exit pupil is given by:
$$\begin{align}
 & \frac{1}{s_{p}}+ \frac{1}{s_{p}^{'}}= \frac{1}{f} \\
 & s_{p}=3cm,f=5cm \\
\implies & s_{p}^{'}=- \frac{15}{2}cm \\
\implies & m=- \frac{s_{p}^{'}}{s_{p}}=\frac{5}{2} \\
\implies & h_{p}^{'}=mh_{p}=5 cm
\end{align}$$
where $h_{p}$ is the diameter of the diaphragm. So the exit pupil is located at $-\frac{15}{2}cm$ to the left of the lens, with a diameter of $5cm$. It is not inverted.

If we view the optical system from the center of the entrance pupil, the lens would subtends the smallest angle. Then the lens is the field stop. 

The entrance window is obviously the lens itself, since there's no optics between the lens and the input plane. The exit window is also the lens itself, since there's no optics between the lens and the output plane.

## b).
Obviously, the image of the object is formed at exactly the same position with the same magnification as in a). Because the equations are the same. The image is at $\frac{60}{7}cm$ to the right of the lens, inverted, with a size of $\frac{10}{7}cm$.

Consider the image of the diaphragm in the object space:
$$\begin{align}
 & \frac{1}{s_{d}}+ \frac{1}{s_{d}^{'}}= \frac{1}{f} \\
 & s_{d}=2.5cm, f=5cm \\
\implies & s_{d}^{'}= -5 cm \\
\implies & m= - \frac{s_{d}^{'}}{s_{d}}=2 \\
\implies & h_{d}^{'} = mh_{d}=4cm
\end{align}$$
Since it subtends a smaller angle than the lens, it is the aperture stop. By the calculation above, the entrance pupil is located at $5cm$ to the right of the lens, not inverted, with a diameter of $4cm$. 

The exit pupil is obviously the diaphragm itself. 

Standing at the center of the aperture stop, the only optical element that limit the field of view is the lens. So the lens is the field stop. 

The entrance and exits windows are obviously the lens itself.

## a).
Set object distance as $s$. Then the image distance is $L-s$. Then I have:
$$\begin{align}
 & \frac{1}{s}+ \frac{1}{L-s}=\frac{1}{f} \\
 \implies & s^{2}-Ls+fL=0 \\
\implies  & s_{1}+s_{2}=-Ls,s_{1}s_{2}=fL \\
\implies & |s_{1}-s_{2}|=\sqrt{ (s_{1}+s_{2})^{2}-4s_{1}s_{2} }=\sqrt{ L^{2} -fL}=D \\
\implies & f= \frac{L^{2}-D^{2}}{4L}
\end{align}$$
Note that in the second step, I applied Vieta's formulas.
## b).
If $L<4f$, we cannot find any real images on the screen. This is because for the derivation in a). to hold, we require the quadratic equation to have real roots. This requires that:
$$L^{2}-4fL\geq {0}\implies L\geq 4f$$
If this is not satisfied, we don't have any real solutions of $s$.

## c).
It's better to have $L$ much larger than $f$. This is because if $L$ is large, then $D$ is large, which is evident from the equation in a). . Then the error in measuring the distances would be small. If $L \cong 4f$, then $D$ is almost zero and very hard to measure.
