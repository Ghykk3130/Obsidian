## (a)

Given a lattice vector $\mathbf{R}$, it must belong to some lattice plane defined by $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$. Say this plane is the $m$th plane from the plane crossing the origin along the $\hat{n}$ direction. Then:
$$\mathbf{R}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}=2\pi md$$
Then:
$$\begin{align}
 & \mathbf{R}\cdot \frac{2\pi}{d}  \hat{\mathbf{n}}=2\pi m
\end{align}$$
So clearly, $\frac{2\pi}{d}  \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector.
